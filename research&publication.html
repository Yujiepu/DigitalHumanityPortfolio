                    <p style="line-height:2.0">My research examines the intersection of medical and legal practices in
                        the construction and regulation of madness during the Qing dynasty in China. The primary focus
                        of this project is to understand how ‚Äúmadness‚Äù came to be institutionalized and how the state,
                        through its judiciary system, regulated and shaped perceptions of madness. This project moves
                        beyond the scope of mental hospitals and instead explores the role of the judiciary system,
                        which functioned as a component of the bureaucracy in late imperial China. Supported by
                        fellowships from Graduate College and the Center for East Asian and Pacific Studies, I conducted
                        research in historical archives in mainland China for a year to examine historical sources
                        including administrative handbooks, memorials to the throne, homicide cases from the collection
                        of Routine Memorials, Ba-County archives, and medical texts. I argue that the imperial state
                        gradually came to recognize the authority of medical assessments in insanity trials. It was a
                        bottom-up process involving commoners, doctors, local officials, and bureaucrats in the Ministry
                        of Justice, negotiating terminology, treatment efficacy, and legal responsibilities related to
                        "mad" convicts. Ultimately, these negotiations led to new understandings and approaches to
                        regulate "mad" convicts before the introduction of Western psychiatry and related laws.

                        Contrary to prevailing scholarship that emphasizes the importation of psychiatric concepts into
                        China as a pivotal moment, this study unveils a distinctive form of medical authority. This
                        authority enjoys social favor and legal sanction, aligning closely with contemporary legal
                        practices while deliberately marginalizing religious interpretations of madness. By proposing an
                        indigenous evolution of medical and legal frameworks concerning mental illness, this research
                        diverges from Western-centric Foucauldian analyses of the history of madness. This invites a
                        reassessment of the assumption that 'modern medicine' is inherently European, and that
                        'psychiatry' represents the exclusive modern approach to understanding and treating madness.
