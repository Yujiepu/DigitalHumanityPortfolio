                <p>
                    <br>
                    I am Yujie (Elena) Pu. I received my Ph.D. degree from Department of East Asian
                    Languages & Cultures at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2024. I got my Master of Arts degree in
                    History from Chinese University of Hong Kong. My research examines the intersection of medical and legal
                    practices in the construction and regulation of madness during the Qing dynasty in China. The primary focus
                    of this project is to understand how madness was institutionalized and how the state, through its judiciary
                    system, regulated and shaped perceptions of madness.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My journey as a first-generation college student, along with my academic pursuits in both Asia and
                    the U.S., has equipped me with diverse educational perspectives. Drawing from my experiences, I
                    incorporate real-life narratives of an Asian navigating different academic terrains, highlighting
                    the contrasts and commonalities between Eastern and Western education systems. This multi-faceted
                    approach not only broadens students' understanding but also fosters a culture of inclusivity in the
                    classroom, encouraging every student to bring their unique stories to the academic discourse.
