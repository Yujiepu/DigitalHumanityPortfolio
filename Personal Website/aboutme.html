                        I am Yujie (Elena) Pu, Lecturer/Instructor of Imperial Chinese History in the Department of East Asian Languages 
                        and Cultures at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I earned my Ph.D. from UIUC in 2025 and hold a Master 
                        of Arts in History from the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
                    <br><br>
                        My research explores the intersection of crime, law, and medicine in late imperial China, with a focus on how judicial 
                        and medical authorities constructed, institutionalized, and regulated madness under the Qing dynasty. I am currently 
                        developing a book manuscript titled Legal Justice, Medical Authority, and Madness in China, 1600-1930, and conducting 
                        comparative studies on Euro-Asian histories of insanity, doctor-patient relationships, Manchu medical texts, and the 
                        pharmaceutical industry in East Asia.
                    <br><br>
                        At UIUC, I teach both broad survey courses, such as Contemporary East Asia, Chinese Civilization, China Under the 
                        Qing Dynasty, and History of Medicine in China. My work has been supported by a 2025 National Science Foundation Travel 
                        Grant from History of Science Society and a fellowship of Inclusive Pedagogy Certificate Program at UIUC's 
                        Office of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion.
                    <br><br>
                        As a first-generation college student who has studied across Asia and the United States, I bring diverse educational 
                        perspectives into every classroom. By sharing real-life narratives of navigating Eastern and Western academic terrains, 
                        I aim to foster an inclusive environment where each student feels empowered to contribute their unique story to our 
                        collective discourse.
